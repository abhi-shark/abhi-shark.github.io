            <h1>Hi, I'm Abhishek Nair. Also the video above is a cool placeholder until I find something more engineering related</h1>
            <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer</p>
            <p>Welcome to my engineering portfolio. Here, you'll find a 
                collection of my projects, experiences and skills in the field 
                of Mechanical Engineering, as well as software or simulation 
                projects I have done in my academic and professional career.<br>
                Please note this website is still under construction as I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript as quickly as I can, and learning to implement features as quickly as I can <br>
                Mobile formatting may also be off, so please temporarily view this website on a display somewhat close to 16:9 if possible. <br>
                <br>Current progress:  <ul>
                    <li>Home Page: WIP</li>
                    <li>About Me: 80% - Need to fix resume and transcript buttons, add skills to PDC role</li>
                    <li>Engineering Projects: 20% Projects until Spring 2023 added. Need images and description for earlier projects.
                        First add skeleton for all projects, then add images and descriptions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Software Projects: WIP - Empty. Start once engineering projects is completed with the same code (reuse!)</li>
                    <li>Contact Me: 100% - Try it out and send me an email!</li>
                </ul>
